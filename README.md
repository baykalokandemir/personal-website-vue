# personal-website-vue
 Personal Website. Was planned to be hosted on https://www.okanbaykal.xyz/. Used Vue.JS 2 framework to utilize components, like the card on baykalokandemir.github.io.
 As Vue 3 is now a thing, and I've grown over neumorphic design since making these components, I'm archiving this repository and will be remaking all components in Vue 3 and redesigning the cards in a design language that screams 2010s less.
